        * Here write all class but there are some issues so I mention please correct

                1. the designs shows the entities.

                Strengths: The design shows most of the key entities required for a Battleship game,
                * including Game, Player, Fleet, Grid, Cell, and Ship classes. The entities are well-defined and have clear responsibilities.
                Improvements: The design could be more comprehensive by including a Position class and a Shot class to represent game actions more explicitly.
                *  Suggestions: Consider adding a Position class to encapsulate x and y coordinates, and a Shot class to represent a player's action.
                * This would make the design more complete and easier to understand.

                2.  it be to add future scope requirements.

                Strengths: The use of interfaces (Ship) and inheritance (specific ship types) allows for easy addition of new ship types.
                *  The separation of concerns between different classes provides a good foundation for extensibility.

                Improvements: The design could be more flexible in terms of game rules and player actions.
                * The current implementation might make it challenging to add new game modes or player strategies.

                Suggestions: Consider introducing a GameRules class to encapsulate game logic,
                * and a PlayerStrategy interface to allow for different AI implementations.
                *  This would make it easier to add new game modes and AI players in the future.

                3. the designs follow SOLID principles


                Strengths: The design shows some adherence to SOLID principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
                * with classes having focused responsibilities, and the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) with the Ship interface allowing for easy addition of new ship types.

                Improvements: The design could better follow the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
                *  Some classes, like Game and Player, have multiple responsibilities that could be further separated.

                 Suggestions: Consider breaking down the Player class into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., PlayerBoard, PlayerActions).
                 *  Introduce interfaces for dependencies to adhere to DIP, such as IGrid or IFleet, to make the system more modular and easier to test.


                4. the design is using Interfaces, Abstract classes correctly .

                Strengths: The design correctly uses the Ship interface to define a contract for different types of ships,
                *  allowing for polymorphism and easier extension of ship types.

                Improvements: While interfaces are used, there's room for more abstract classes to share common implementation details among similar classes.

                Suggestions: Consider introducing an abstract class AbstractShip that implements
                * the Ship interface and provides common functionality for all ship types.
                * This would reduce code duplication in the specific ship classes like Submarine, AircraftCarrier, etc.


                Q5. How well the design is creating relationships between the entities like Inheritance, Composition, Aggregation etc ?


                Strengths: The design shows good use of composition (e.g., Game has a list of Players, Player has a Fleet and Grids)
                * and inheritance (specific ship types inheriting from Ship interface).

                Improvements: Some relationships could be more clearly defined, such as the relationship between Cell and Ship.

                Suggestions: Consider using more explicit aggregation for relationships like Fleet-Ship and Grid-Cell.
                *  For example, you could make Fleet responsible for creating and managing Ship objects, strengthening the relationship between these classes.

        /*
        * Hereâ€™s an improved version of your Battleship design, addressing the points you mentioned:

        Key Improvements:
        Entity Clarifications:

        Added Position and Shot classes to represent coordinates and game actions explicitly.
        Improved relationships between Player, Fleet, Grid, Ship, and Cell using composition and aggregation.
        Future Extensibility:

        Added a GameRules class to allow custom game logic and rules (e.g., different board sizes, new game modes).
        Introduced a PlayerStrategy interface to support human vs AI or different AI strategies in the future.
        SOLID Principles:

        Single Responsibility: Separated responsibilities of Player into PlayerBoard and PlayerActions to focus on grid management and actions, respectively.
        Open/Closed: Used interfaces and abstract classes where appropriate to allow easy extensions (e.g., adding more ship types).
        Interface Segregation: Each class now has focused interfaces, avoiding large, multipurpose interfaces.
        Dependency Inversion: Used interfaces (like IGrid, IFleet) to decouple classes from direct dependencies.
        Inheritance and Composition:

        Used abstract classes for ships, such as AbstractShip, to reduce duplicate code and shared logic across all ship types.
        Strengthened aggregation between Fleet and Ship, and Grid and Cell, making the relationships clearer.
